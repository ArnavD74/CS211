To use the auto-grading script, simply run the a.sh shell script in the same directory of the test cases folder, and your wordcount.c file. 

To run the shell script:

`chmod +x a.sh` (you only need to do this once, it makes the script executable)

`./a.sh` (you can run this as many times as you want)
